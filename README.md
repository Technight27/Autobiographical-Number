# Autobiographical Number
An autobiographical number is a number (N) such that the first digit of N counts how many zeroes are presented in N, the second digit counts how many ones are presented in N, the third digit counts how many twos are presented in N, and so on. Sometimes, it is also known as a curious number.
i have programmed a code where if it is a  autobiographical no it will display total no of unique digits present in the number
else it will show output as 0
